To compile the program, go to the jar directory that you will have downloaded at the following address:
https://github.com/Tamohagan/Java_Project3

Then type java -jar p3.jar -d.
This will launch it in developer mode.
 
Then, you will be able to choose your game on the home page, either the Mastermind or the search game.
Finally, we will propose you the different mode for each game :
Challenger

You have of course the possibility to choose the desired parameter via the config.properties file

Good game!
